## Important Notes

### Git Workflow Requirements (Session 3 Update)

**CRITICAL**: Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory workflow steps:

1. **Before starting new work**: ALWAYS pull main first
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **After creating PR**: STOP and wait for user confirmation of merge
   - **NEVER** continue working on feature branch after PR creation
   - Wait for explicit user confirmation that PR is merged
   - Do NOT assume PR is merged

3. **After PR merge confirmation**: Pull main and create new branch
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/next-task
   ```

**Why this matters**: Prevents working on stale branches, ensures all work builds on latest code, avoids merge conflicts.

### Windows Compatibility
- **Issue**: Hardcoded Linux path `/usr/bin/chromedriver` caused WinError 193
- **Solution**: Using `webdriver-manager` package for cross-platform driver management
- **Testing**: Need to verify on actual Windows machine after merge
