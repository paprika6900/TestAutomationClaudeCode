# NOTEPAD.md

**Purpose**: Active task tracking and session notes for Claude Code.

**Archive**: Old sessions moved to [docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md](docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md) when this file exceeds 300 lines.

## Current Session

**Date**: 2025-10-20 (Morning Session)
**Branch**: main
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - Documentation improvements committed

### Accomplishments

- [x] Analyzed current documentation structure
- [x] Created streamlined CLAUDE.md (189 lines, down from 529)
- [x] Created docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for technical details (568 lines)
- [x] Optimized README.md for scannability (324 lines, down from 452)
- [x] Archived old sessions to docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md
- [x] Committed documentation improvements (commit 4833747)

**Results**: Successfully improved documentation content, handling, and size. Added README.md reading triggers to CLAUDE.md to force appropriate file reading.

### Session Goals

Improve documentation structure per user request:
1. **Content**: Better organized, scannable, actionable
2. **Handling**: Clear triggers to read README.md when needed
3. **Size**: Reduced by ~50% while keeping all information

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Test framework on Windows to verify webdriver-manager fix
- [ ] Review PR #7 status (may need to close/recreate after docs reorganization)

---

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add support for Edge browser
- [ ] Create example tests for additional websites
- [ ] Add screenshot comparison utilities
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions)

## Important Notes

### Documentation Structure (Updated Session 4)

**New streamlined structure**:

| File | Lines | Purpose | Read When |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | 189 (was 529) | Quick workflow reference | Every session start |
| **README.md** | 324 (was 452) | Project overview, setup, quick start | Setup questions, explaining to others |
| **NOTEPAD.md** | ~150 (this file) | Active tasks and current session | Session start, task tracking |
| **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** | ~600 | Detailed technical reference | Implementing features, need examples |
| **docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md** | Archive | Completed session history | Reference past work |

**Key improvements**:
- **64% reduction in CLAUDE.md** - Now scannable quick reference
- **README trigger in CLAUDE.md** - Forces reading when user asks setup/architecture questions
- **Separated concerns** - Workflow vs Documentation vs Technical Details
- **Tables over prose** - Faster scanning
- **Archived history** - Keep NOTEPAD.md lean

### Git Workflow (Critical)

**Before ANY work**:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**After creating PR**:
1. ðŸ›‘ **STOP all work**
2. Wait for user confirmation of merge
3. Then: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`

### Configuration

- **Base URL**: `https://grocerymate.masterschool.com/`
- **Browser**: Chrome (auto-managed via webdriver-manager)
- **Test credentials**: Configured in `config.yaml`

### GroceryMate Test Coverage

**Current Status**: 10 passing tests
- Home page: 4 tests
- Login page: 4 tests
- HTML capture: 2 tests
